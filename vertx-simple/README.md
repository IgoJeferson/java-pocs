# Vert.x Simple

Unlike restrictive traditional application containers, Vert.x gives you incredible power and agility to create compelling, scalable, 21st century applications the way you want to, with a minimum of fuss, in the language you want

## Key points

- Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.
- Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent numbers.
- Vert.x is not an application server. There's no monolithic Vert.x instance into which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.
- Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing more.
- Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps, simply.
- Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
